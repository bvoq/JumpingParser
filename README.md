# JumpingParser
An O(n*log(n)) parser invented by Kevin De Keyser.
This parser still needs some cleanup, but you can look at the testset1() method in order to see how the parser is used.

It can be extended to work for any kind of operator grammar (besides infinite ones, these can be added after the tree has been created, for example an n-ary operator).

Maybe look back at the project once I found the time to clean it up a bit more.
