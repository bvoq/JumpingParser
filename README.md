# JumpingParser
An O(n*log(n)) precedence parser by Kevin De Keyser.
This parser still needs some cleanup, but you can look at the testset1() method in order to see how the parser is used.

You can define any operator you want now! (The nullary operator has to be implemented, but that should only take 15 mins. Will do soon.)
